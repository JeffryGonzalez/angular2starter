# Starter for Angular 2 Training

This project has been created (based on many sources!) to be a suitable starter for the Angular2 training by Hypertheory.

This was created assuming we have node.js version `4.2.4 LTS` installed, along with NPM `2.14.*`.

You should install the following NPM modules globally first:

- `npm install -g grunt`
- `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- `npm install -g typescript`

And then do
 
 `npm install` in the directory you copied/cloned this to.
 
 This project used the grunt task runner. It has several tasks, the default should be enough to get you going,
 though. Just type `gulp` at the command prompt, and open your browser at `http:\\localhost:3000` and you should see the starter page. 
 
 Start coding.
 
 It uses the Webpack dev server.
 
 ## Testing
 
 Testing with Karma.
    
    gulp test
    gulp test.watch
    
## Building

You can build the application. It puts the results in the `target` folder.

    gulp build
